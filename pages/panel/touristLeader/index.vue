    The Company will provide the local guides registered with Deep Treep with
    training courses to understand the client’s requirements to fulfil their
    needs. Deep Treep Courses will include three different kinds of courses for
    their guides: Hartman Personality Test: This course is designed to make
    guides understand the personalities that people exhibit. With this test,
    personalities are given colour codes instead of using names. These colours
    depict a person's traits and how these traits correspond with a person's
    overall personality. Deep Treep Experience: The Company will create its own
    dedicated database centre, where it will collect data and feedback received
    from the previous bookings in the form of multiple- choice questions. This
    will help the system better understand travellers' tastes and desires for
    future recommendations. The course will train the guides in understanding
    and using the data obtained from the database for future reference. Creative
    Photos and Films: This course is designed to help guides learn new and
    creative photography skills to make their client's travel more special and
    memorable by providing them with their travel experience in photos and
    videos. The first two courses are compulsory for all the guides who will
    register themselves with Deep Treep, and the third one is desirable for
    those who are passionate about learning photographic skills, However, this
    course is still compulsory for those who wants to offer creative photos and
    films to the company’s precious customers.
